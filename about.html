        <p><b>*I have told you I would make it in .html*</b></p>
        <p>I am Vincent (aka Shadow), a 16 year old student from Germany.</p>
        <p>I put this webpage together for a school project, and it brought me joy to see it rising out of nothing but my own hands and keyboard.</p>
        <p>My personal hobbys are coding, gaming and learning IT.</p>
        <p>I have a few special interests, mostly IT based, like learning HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
        <p>I started to learn html beacuse of <a>scarlettscafe.lenowo.org</a>. I looked at the website she put together and thought to myself "You can do that too".</p>
        <p>And then I learned to write HTML. CSS follwed shortly after that, and JS is still something I really have to put my head into.</p>
        <p>With the things I have learned in the past 10 weeks, I put together this webpage, but I still cant fully believe, that I accomplished this.</p>
        <p>Although I build this webpage, I could not explain what I did at some points. I just locked in for like 5hrs and put together the JS part (the thing, I understand the least of). </p>
        <p>I hope you like this webpage.</p>
